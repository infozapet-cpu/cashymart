How to use: display, film & gift ideas

Display

Arrange by color or theme on a bookshelf ledge.

Use small acrylic risers for tiered displays.

Place inside a glass display box to protect from dust and preserve mint condition.

Filming & stop-motion

Use a small tripod and consistent lighting.

Plan short, repeatable loops (8â€“12 seconds) for social media.

Gentle nudges between frames work well because the figures are lightweight and easy to reposition.

Gifting & party ideas

Bundle a figure with stickers and a tiny handwritten card for micro-gifts.

Use them as party favors: pop one into a small drawstring bag with candy and a name tag.
